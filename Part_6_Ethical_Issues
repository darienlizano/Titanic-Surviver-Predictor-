# Discussion of Ethical Issuses and Potential Impacts on Society 

## To broaden the subject matter, consider a cruise line company. The company may want to understand more about its customers, such as demographic information. What classifications of its customers may serve its business goals? What ethical issues may arise from these applications?

If a cruise line wants to better understand their customers, they may need to classify their customers to gain this knowledge. Some of the classifications that can be taken from the cruise line are similar to what the Titanic dataset contained, which are customer information. Information such as ticket class, ticket fare, the origin of embarkment, number of parents, children or spouses onboard, and age. These classifiers possess enough information so that the company can have a better understanding of who they are serving. From this, they can also see who they are not serving, and figure out methods and strategies to reach those consumers who are not onboard. Ultimately, classifying their customers can expand their company, if done correctly. 
It should not go without mentioning the ethical issues of this form of data collection. There are ongoing debates about how companies collect and use customer data that seem to be troubling to some. The more information the company collects about the customer, the more likely they are to receive backlash from the public. One ethical issue that may derive is the handling of minor’s data. Consent of minor’s information is one that needs to be regulated. If a cruise line company can gain information from all of its passengers, that includes minors. Another ethical issue can be forms of discrimination. In particular, this will most likely occur if the cruise line company decides to customize it’s services according to it’s majority demographics. As seen in our analysis of the titanic data, there were a few outliers within certain variables, meaning that there were groups of people who did not fit into the majority demographic that were onboard. Servicing the majority may fuel discrimination issues, which is a significant issue.
